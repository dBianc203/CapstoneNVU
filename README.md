Capstone Project for NVU. This project is a website that allows users to keep track of their workouts along with keeping track of their BMI

The first page you'll see when entering the website is the home page, this is where you'll enter all your information. Things like your height,weight, and age will all be taken into consideration when calculating your BMI.

The finished product should keep track of your BMI the last time you enetered the info and will change over time depedning on what the user enters when they want to update any of their information.

The about us page is brief, just a generic page that basically explains why this website/project exists and what it's meant to do.

![](READMEimages/Contact%20Us%20ex%201.jpg)
The Contact us page will be used for any user that has questions related to the site, currently there is a form setup to enter your name,email, and subject of what you want to send. The final version will have a full-functional form used to send an email to a certain destination.

![](READMEimages/Your%20Workouts%20ex%201.jpg)
This will be the main part of the website. Here you can enter your workouts and view pastworkouts aswell. Right now, there is nothing but the finished version will have a working system where you can log your exercises.Most of the project work will focus on this part of the website, everything above is more for aesthetics.

![](READMEimages/Home%20Bar%201.jpg)
This bar will bring bring the user to the part of the page that they click on, so that they dont have to scroll down to whatever part of the page they want to be at. Should have it so that the bar stays on the top of the users screen regardless of what page they are on, and not just the home page.
